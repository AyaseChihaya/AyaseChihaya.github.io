The task of room layout estimation is to locate the wall-floor, wall-ceiling, and wall-wall boundaries. Most recent methods solve this problem based on edge/keypoint detection or semantic segmentation. However, these approaches have shown limited attention on the geometry of the dominant planes and the intersection between them, which has significant impact on room layout. In this work, we propose to incorporate geometric reasoning to deep learning for layout estimation. Our approach learns to infer the depth maps of the dominant planes in the scene by predicting the pixel-level surface parameters, and the layout can be generated by the intersection of the depth maps. Moreover, we present a new dataset with pixel-level depth annotation of dominant planes. It is larger than the existing datasets and contains both cuboid and non-cuboid rooms. Experimental results show that our approach produces considerable performance gains on both 2D and 3D datasets.

An illustration of our method that can be trained w/wo depth supervision. Given an input image, the pixel-level surface parameters are predicted by the network. They are aggregated into several instance-level parameters to produce the depth maps of the planar surfaces. Based on the 2D segmentation, these depth maps can be combined into a stitched depth map, which is evaluated by either the ground truth (w/ depth supervision) or the minimal depth value of the predicted depth maps for each pixel localization (w/o depth supervision).
